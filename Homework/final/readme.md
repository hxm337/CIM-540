# Music & Art

This project is meant to be used as an additional experience to museum-going. I went to the Lowe art museum to observe this collection, and created a playlist to pair with the feelings and indications the art gave me. My intention is to further contextualize the art with a musical experience as well as the visual experience. Users can use their phone and headphones to click through this project while in the museum to have music to go along with the paintings.

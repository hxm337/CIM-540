Sun, Moon, and Stars

This project is an exploratory world to interact with the sun, moon and stars. I thought of this as an idea, more so for children, as a fun way practice motor skills on computers, follow directions, and to see aspects of space appear and disappear with their interactions. Each page gives you different ways to interact with and add things to the universe. This includes mousePressed, mouseX mouseY, buttons, hitzones, and for loops and arrays to animate the universe. Each page gives instruction on what interactions are available.
